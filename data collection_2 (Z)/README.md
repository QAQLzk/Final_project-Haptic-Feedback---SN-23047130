## Machine Learning Part
This folder holds code and models about the collected data and machine learning. In the current folder, `x_sensor_data.csv` is the 3-axis magnetic field data detected from the hall sensor, 10 sets are recorded in 1 second and the time unit is accurate to 0.1 s. This is done by reading the serial output and recording it using `csv_write.py`. And `x_SBT.xlsx` is the real 3-axis force sensor data (unit:g) recorded through the software provided by the SBT308.

In the `Test` folder, there is the files about the processed dataset, the ML code and the model. `x_merged.csv` files are integration of the hall sensor data and the SBT data, which only retains and matches data with the same timestamp. `Z_test.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook to  build the MLP and Linear model and evaluation for the Z-axis. And their the best model has saved as `Z_best_model.h5` and `linear_regression_model.pkl`. At the same time, in order to further evaluate the model performance, a K-fold cross-validation approach was used to assess the performance of two different models, and the relevant code was present in `Cross_validation.ipynb` file.
